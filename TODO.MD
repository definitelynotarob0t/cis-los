3. ChatGPT suggestions for security: 
    - Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on your sign-up route. You can use libraries like express-rate-limit.
    - Security Headers: Ensure you're using security headers like Content-Security-Policy and X-Content-Type-Options to enhance security.
    - HTTPS for API Calls: Ensure your frontend is sending sensitive information like email and password over HTTPS. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
