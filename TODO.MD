1. Write a README file
2. Check security best practices. ChatGPT suggestions: 
    - Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on your sign-up route. You can use libraries like express-rate-limit.
    - Security Headers: Ensure you're using security headers like Content-Security-Policy and X-Content-Type-Options to enhance security.
    - HTTPS for API Calls: Ensure your frontend is sending sensitive information like email and password over HTTPS. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. PDF functionality
4. Ensure refresh is working correctly - do not navigate to a different page
5. Testing (end-to-end)
6. Ensure persistence (currently not working in LOS)
7. Check the bootstrap icons error: The request url "/Users/briannaspinks/repos/cis-los/node_modules/bootstrap-icons/font/fonts/bootstrap-icons.woff" is outside of Vite serving allow list.
